package driver

// The hearth driver protocol shapes are defined canonically as zod
// schemas in @rocky-hq/contracts/src/hearth/ and consumed in Go via the
// generated bindings at github.com/rocky-hq/contracts/go/hearth.
//
// This file re-exports the generated types and named constants under
// `package driver` so the rest of hearth (driver.go, fake/, future
// localdocker/) keeps the short names `Tier`, `DeploymentRef`, etc.
// DO NOT add new types here; extend the zod source.
